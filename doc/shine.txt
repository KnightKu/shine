SYNOPSIS
========
General syntax overview:

    ``shine`` *command* [ OPTIONS ]


DESCRIPTION
===========
``shine`` is a command line tool designed to setup and manage the Lustre
filesystem on a cluster. It aims at centralize and simplify Lustre filesystem
management task with:

    * one human-readable configuration file to describe your filesystem

    * start, stop, format (and more) your filesystem from an unique machine, thanks to a simple command line interface.

It is still in beta stage (feedbacks are welcomed).



INVOCATION
==========

Here is the description of the supported commands:

`show` <keyword> [ OPTIONS ]
    Show configuration parameters. Supported `show` keywords are detailed below:

        * `conf`: List loaded *shine.conf*\(5) configuration parameters.

        * `fs` [-v]: Show installed filesystems (with optional description)

        * `info` [-f <fsname>]: Show installed filesystem information.

        * `storage`: Show File backend storage configuration.

        * `tuning`: Show defined tuning configuration.

`install`
    Install  a  filesystem  from a model file. The model file may describe
    the entire Lustre filesystem or only target patterns  that  will  match
    Shine backend entries.  By installing, we mean that shine will generate
    a filesystem configuration  and  will spread it to the concerned nodes
    (MGS, MDS, OSS and clients).

`remove`
    Remove an installed file system. This command removes the filesystem
    description but nothing is done on the various targets involved  in
    the considered  filesystem (no reformatting of freed target is done).

`format`
    Format an installed filesystem.

`status`
    Get filesystem current status. See -V option below to specify a status view.

`start`
    Start filesystem servers.

`stop`
    Stop filesystem servers.

`mount`
    Mount filesystem clients.

`umount`
    Un-mount filesystem clients.

`tune`
     Apply tuning parameters to an existing file system. This command  is
     automatically launched on server nodes at the end of the start operation
     and on the client nodes at the end of the mount phase.


OPTIONS
=======

-f <FSNAME>
    Name of the installed filesystem that will be processed by the command.

-i <INDEXES>
    Select specified Lustre target numeric index(es). Ranges like `4-8,10`
    are allowed here.

-l <LABELS>
    Select specified Lustre target by label(s).

-n <NODES>
    Select specified nodes that will be processed (comma-separated list of
    nodes or nodeset, eg. cluster[2-10/2]).

-m <LMF_FILE_PATH>
    Path to the Lustre model  file  (LMF)  that  describes  the  new filesystem
    that will be installed. If only the name of the LMF file is provided, the
    ``shine`` command assumes that the file is located in the
    `/etc/shine/models` directory.

-q
    Quiet mode.

-t <TARGETS>
    Process only specified target list (comma-separated). Valid targets are:

        * mgt
        * mdt
        * ost

-v
    Enable verbose mode.

-V {disk|fs|target}
    Option used to specify the type of information that will be displayed.
    Current available views are:
        
        * `disk`: information related to physical storage device status
        * `fs`: information related to filesystem status
        * `target`: information related to target status

-x <NODES>
    Exclude specified nodes (comma-separated list of nodes or nodeset).
-y
    Answer *Yes* to confirmation prompt (for example, on format).


EXIT STATUS
===========

An exit status of zero indicates success of the ``shine`` command.


EXAMPLES
===========

:# shine install -m /etc/shine/models/lustre1.lmf:
    Install shine configuration files on remote nodes for this filesystem.

:# shine format -f lustre1:
    Format filesystem `lustre1`.

:# shine start -f lustre1:
    Start `lustre1` servers.

:# shine mount -f lustre1 -n cluster[5-6]:
    Mount `lustre1` filesystem on node cluster5 and cluster6.
